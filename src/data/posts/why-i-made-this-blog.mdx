# Also Zoidberg.

The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Your best is an idiot! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Five hours? Aw, man! **Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?** _Now, now._ Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.

## Ask her how her day was.

I'll get my kit! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

1. You don't know how to do any of those.
2. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.
3. Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

### You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!

- Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
- Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
- You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

That's not soon enough! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Moving along… Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!

Okay, I like a challenge. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Meh.

I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Ow, my spirit! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Oh God, what have I done? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Your best is an idiot! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

I'm a thing. Why would I want to know that? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.

Hello Morbo, how's the family? You can see how I lived before I met you. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Why would I want to know that?

There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Really?! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.

All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Is the Space Pope reptilian!? If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.
